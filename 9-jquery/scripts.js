// DO NOT CHANGE THE HTML FILE

	// 1 - After the DOM loads, add a paragraph tag that says "Page loaded"
	// to the section element

	// 2 - Change the text of the h1 element to something (anything!) else.

  // 3 - Get rid of (delete) the useless unordered list (ul) by first
  // selecting the h2 nested within its list item.
